# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data, the task emphasizes accurate classification and evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
- Credit Card Transactions Dataset
- Target column: Class (0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📊 Results
The model effectively identifies fraudulent transactions and provides a strong baseline for fraud detection systems.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights the role of data analytics and machine learning in financial fraud prevention and can be extended using advanced models and real-time systems.
